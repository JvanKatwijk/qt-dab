The viterbi implementation is copied from the spiral one, all
rights gratefully acknowledged.
Since we serve more than a single platform, we do not use the SSE
implementation.

The particular spiral implementation (see the file spiral_no_sse.c"
is generated for the wordsize and the other parameters for FIC blocks.
The implementation therefore has a "switch", that - when set to true -
selects the spiral implementation, and - when set to false (the default) -
it uses the generic implementation.
