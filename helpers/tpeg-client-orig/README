Qt-DAB has as one of its configuration options, an option
to send decoded (but not interpreted{ TPEG data to a TCP port,
By default, port 8888 is chosen, but a command line parameter in Qt-DAB
allows another port to be selected (Note that this setting is NOT
maintained between program invocations).

if - in configurating Qt-DAB - the option 
CONFIG          += datastreamer
is uncommented, the relevant modules are included in the Qt-DAB
program.
If configured, TPEG data is sent in packages, with a header
	localBuffer [0] = 0xFF;
        localBuffer [1] = 0x00;
        localBuffer [2] = 0xFF;
        localBuffer [3] = 0x00;
        localBuffer [4] = (length & 0xFF) >> 8;
        localBuffer [5] = length & 0xFF;
        localBuffer [6] = 0x00;
        localBuffer [7] = frametype == 0 ? 0 : 0xFF;
through the aforementioned port.

This directory contains the source for a simple client that reads
the data and dispatches it, the assumption being that proprietary
encoding or encryptions are added by the user.
